Current research was conducted by KoCad to investigate potential biases as well as the gender disparity issues that may exist in Black Saber’s recruitment, wage, and promotion schemes. To study the potential gender bias in the company’s salary and promoting systems, we evaluated whether employees at the company were being paid and promoted fairly and that those processes were not influenced by discriminatory factors such as gender. We also investigated whether or not any kind of bias was included in each hiring phase that uses either the AI service or the score ratings of interviewers who evaluated applicants.
